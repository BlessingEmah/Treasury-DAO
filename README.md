DESIGN ARCHITECTURE
I built a treasury DAO which does the following:

For someone to join, they have to contribute to become an Investor.
Their contribution determines their voting shares.
Investors can transfer shares to each other but they need to have a minimum balance.

Only Investors can create proposals
Only Investors can vote on a proposal.
