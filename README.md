I built a treasury DAO which does the following:

    Collects investor money(ether)
    keep track of investor contributions with shares - keep track of investor money with shares(ethers)
    allow investors to transfer shares
    allow investment proposals to be created and voted - investor proposal by investor and voted
    execute successful investment proposals (i.e send money) - send ether to the approved proposals
